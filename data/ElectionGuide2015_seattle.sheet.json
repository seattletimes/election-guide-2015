Last November’s vote to increase transit service was a strong indication the people of Seattle want to see positive action on transportation. The Move Seattle Levy this November is another opportunity.",

These same strategies should be used in other neighborhoods\nwhere street crime and disorder is concentrated.",
    "sea_tents": "City-sanctioned encampments should be located along transit lines and close to human\nservices in multifamily and commercial areas of the city. I do not favor them in single-family neighborhoods because we don’t allow the intensity of multifamily facilities in\nthese neighborhoods.",

    "sea_movement": "We are still far too car-dependent, which is an ecological and infrastructure disaster. We missed a big opportunity decades ago to invest in mass transit to have light rail connect our urban villages, and must now double down on transit investments to connect our communities.",
    "sea_safety": "We still hear too many reports of excessive force followed by weak disciplinary action even in clear cases. We must have a police force that is accountable in cases of police brutality, and accountable to our neighborhoods. This starts with increased civilian oversight from the Office of Professional Accountability in order to investigate misconduct with greater impartiality, and fully implementing the recommendations of the Community Police Commission.",
    "sea_tents": "It is important to remember that the homeless are our neighbors, too. I believe city-sanctioned encampments are a responsible and safe way for people to survive absent other housing options. The city must work with residential neighborhoods collaboratively  to identify locations that work for all our neighbors, those with or without a permanent home. ",

    "sea_housing": "I support a vast majority of the recommendations. The recommendations to implement a commercial linkage fee and the creation of a mandatory inclusionary zoning program will create 6,000 much-needed affordable housing units in the next 10 years. This is the kind of action we need to take now to give working people a shot at continuing to live and work in our growing city.  ",
    "sea_movement": "The city faces a $3 billion backlog of maintenance and overdue neighborhood improvements. The Let’s Move Seattle levy expands the number and type of projects that will be built -- the dozen bridges that will be replaced, the hundreds of miles of roads that will be repaved, the street lights that will be synchronized, the transit corridors that will be improved, the sidewalks that will be built.",
    "sea_safety": "I am a strong supporter of the LEAD program as a strategy to help reduce criminal behavior that threatens our quality of life.  I believe that strategies like it, coupled with public/private partnerships and investing in mental health and housing services, is the key to making significant improvements to public safety downtown and citywide.",
    "sea_tents": "No. I understand concerns but encampments serve a critical function for people experiencing homelessness. The city has a moral obligation to provide space for responsible, non-profit service providers to deliver critical services in a safe environment to the most vulnerable people in our city.",
    "sea_drilling": "The city has a responsibility to ensure that those seeking to do business in its jurisdiction follow our land use and related permitting laws. The Port of Seattle is not exempted from this principle. I am opposed to Arctic drilling and, like most of Seattle, believe that the Port’s decision to host this equipment is inconsistent with our values of staunchly protecting our environment to combat climate change.

The failure to balance job and housing growth (e.g. South Lake Union), or to build housing near the south end light-rail stops (instead allowing developers to build in transit challenged areas like Ballard), indicate failed growth strategies and planning.",
    "sea_safety": "Downtown’s biggest public-safety issues revolve around systemic failures to address mental illness, addiction and poverty. So increased funding and services in these areas are critical. Throughout the city we need to address the effectiveness of SPD to respond to emergency calls and provide adequate policing in hotspot areas.",
    "sea_tents": "No. The problem is pervasive city wide, and as a temporary solution we need to provide safe, well-managed places for homeless people to find shelter and establish themselves. In tandem with this we need to aggressively build permanent low-income housing throughout the city.",
    "sea_drilling": "The city would have a minor role under its authority for use permitting (as is currently in front of the hearing examiner). But the Port of Seattle needs to exert greater progressive leadership on this issue.",
