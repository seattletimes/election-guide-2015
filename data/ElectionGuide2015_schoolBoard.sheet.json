    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "The issue around financing seems to come up a lot. We have a school district with a budget of $1 billion, but it seems the school district is asking for more from the public. We need to make sure we are spending our funds efficiently. That goes to the second issue, with special education. Our district is under direct oversight by the federal government for violations involving special education funding. We need to make sure we communicate to the public we are spending that money in the most effective way we can.",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "They should also be looking at other inequities, because there are 6,300 students in special education that are being underserved. If we push to serve all of our students equally, without labels, I think that is a better approach. I think the gap is more of a socio-economic problem than a racial problem, and the data shows show that they need more support. ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "I wouldn’t have voted to take legal action. Any time you delay getting into school and on track, it’s harmful to students. On the other hand, when you are in a union and you are feeling you aren’t getting respect, the only path you have is the strike. I understand both sides. I met with several groups of teachers during and after the strike and said maybe they should have gone back to school, but continued to negotiate and take the high road. They had a lot of support, maybe they could have come to the same result. ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "Common Core was the Trojan horse in Race to the Top. It was poorly planned and implemented. If we are serious that the purpose of school is students going on to careers, we need to make sure they have the skills needed. The only way we can do that is through some testing, but not high-stakes testing. If you have any employee and after a year they fail, that is the failure of management because they should have had checkpoints. The way you do that is through testing."

    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "Seattle Public Schools is losing the faith of the community. I want to show that, yes, I am here to listen. We may have to learn to deal with bureaucracy, but I am here to listen, especially for the underserved, underrepresented children that don’t get through the system.",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "One of the things that can be done is reduce class size, because it’s easy for students to feel marginalized when the teacher doesn’t have enough time for every student. We need to sustain that through the eighth grade, so students feel valued, and then I think that we will see success in the high schools. ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "I supported the teachers; it wasn’t just about money. There needed to be more common ground. Sometimes change needs to come from within, and they were able to get the change. I would have voted no to let (Superintendent Larry) Nyland pursue legal action. Negotiations should have been done before school started.",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "There is too much standardized testing right now. Part of my role has been working with students who are coming right out of high school to the University of Washington, and I definitely see the change in abilities. They may have As, but when you look at their ACT and SAT scores, those scores have been going down. I wonder if that is because teachers had to stop teaching (students) how to learn and had to teach to the test. As far as the Common Core, it would be great if we could get it to work, but it may just be that: Common. We need to have excellent standards. ",

    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "There is a lack of communication and transparency. Seattle Public Schools isn’t including us in the process. I just know that for every problem they have, there won’t be an easy fix. It’s educating the administration and changing the district culture. Seattle Public Schools needs to engage and include the communities in the process.",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "Equity teams should be at all the schools, and we really do need to invest in closing the gap. Because I’m deaf, I’ve seen that people tend to think of people of color or people with disabilities as an afterthought. If Seattle Public Schools is going to close the gap, they need to stop taking money away from the programs that are already in place. It’s all about changing people’s perceptions and how we affect each other.  ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "I thought it was about time to have the strike because we needed to have these discussions about education, funding, pay wages, and the list goes on. Seattle is exploding, and I am hearing from teachers who say they are thinking about moving and/or getting a job closer to where they live because they cannot afford to live in the city. We need to take that into account, because we can’t afford to lose our teachers. I was upset that most of the board voted to authorize (Superintendent Larry) Nyland to engage in legal action. They should have told him to please try to work it out with SEA (Seattle Education Association.)  ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "The tests are so rigid, which hurts students with disabilities, and affects every student. I don’t think the tests are very fair; when the Common Core standards were created they didn’t take input from special education teachers. We really need to get back to critical thinking, because when students get to college, they won’t be memorizing everything. Common Core is already a state law and in the schools, so we should be engaging with the community to hear what they want. We also need to go back to state legislators and the creators of Common Core to request changes. ",

    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "The biggest issue comes down to what I have picked as my campaign slogan: Let’s get back to learning. When I think about where we put our funding, where we put our priorities, learning is always No. 1. I think we have lost our focus on learning. Teachers have administrative burdens, and a lot of non-teaching or prep has been put on them, and all of that takes away from teaching and learning, and that is the most important thing, why we send our kids to school. ",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "We have made huge progress, but it is clear we aren’t done. Seattle Public Schools has to be able to deal with socio-economic disparities and racial and cultural challenges as well. My hope is that we can advocate for and connect with city programs and community-based organizations, because the communities know best what cultural identity factors are the highest priority. ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "It was very emotionally charged, and there was misinformation from both sides. I felt that it wasn’t super transparent or respectful. And when the teachers reached the point where they decided to strike and the response from the school board was to authorize an injunction, it was really just a slap in the face. It showed they weren’t truly supportive of the requests of the teachers. I wouldn’t have approved it, I would have looked for a different type of message to send. ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "I have had a lot of experiences with standards and see the value and power of them. They are supposed to shape student learning, but really, they shape textbooks and assessments. My concern is we put a lot of money into training for the standards, but don’t think we are getting the bang for our buck. I do support some form of assessment, but Smarter Balanced is too big, too expensive, and takes too long. Most families still don’t know how their kids did. It’s not worth it over time. "

    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "There are three issues: The first is the opportunity gap. It’s unacceptable that students of color are falling through the cracks. We need to repair our relationships with our teachers and recognize them as a source of insight, knowledge and solutions to the problems we are trying to fix. And the third issue is the extreme amount of growth, which creates instability in our school system. ",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "We need to engage with our community and talk to our families. Whatever we do, they need to be involved in the solution. We also need to maintain programs for schools that are working to close the opportunity gap and for these kids in the gap, keeping them in the general education curriculum, even if they are struggling. If you put them in a remedial class, it’s harder for them to keep up. There should be professional development for teachers so they can help the kids, because if they aren’t in schools, then they can’t graduate. ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "The district was disorganized and came in not really prepared for what they needed to do for the bargaining team. I think there should have been an ongoing collaboration with stakeholders long before the contract came up, with teachers, students, parents. For example, the district was asking for more instructional time, but they should have asked “what does that look like?” There should have been a conversation long before it got to the bargaining table.",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "I don’t think testing should be punitive for students, teachers or schools. I think it should be a diagnostic tool to ask, “Where do we need to do to improve?” The Common Core is not the only thing we need to teach, but it’s reasonable we have some sort of standards. Just by having this consistency, for elementary students, when these kids get to middle school, they are on the same playing field, and it makes life easier for our middle and high school teachers.

    "What is the biggest issue facing Seattle Public Schools, and how do you plan to address it?": "The biggest issue is the funding necessary to create smaller class sizes, which has been requested by the public and will be at the core of improving education for kids. We have to make sure we have the right data necessary to understand growth, because we can’t have a plan unless we know how the district will grow. And we need to work with the city to identify sites for schools, then we need to advocate more than we are now, talking to different legislators throughout the region to fund the initiatives for smaller class sizes. ",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "I appreciate that Harium (Martin-Morris) brought the moratorium on suspensions for elementary students, and it’s going to take more than just a resolution on the part of the school board. There may be times when a child cannot effectively be in a classroom, but if a child must be removed, they must have some place to go. The achievement gap is being fueled by pulling them from school. They are falling behind.",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "I thought the strike was fair and the teachers need the resources they were asking for. They were fighting for resources they need in terms of time and culture, and I appreciated that. When the school board came to the district to file a lawsuit against the teachers, the school board had the authority to grant the lawsuit that, but, as elected officials, they granted it too early and without due diligence.  ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "I’m not a huge fan of Common Core or federally-mandated standards but I will say that I think standards are important. It’s a matter of equity. An ‘A’ at one school might be a ‘C’ at another school, and that is so profoundly unfair. We have spent so much time and money procuring and dispensing a test that isn’t wanted by our population, only to get results that might not be any better than the test before. We need to look very carefully at what we want from standardized testing so we can move forward.",

I think that if we work together to daylight some of the processes and the goals and work together, we can get so much father, faster. Given some of the history of Seattle Public Schools, folks have a lack of confidence and trust. I plan to have real conversations, where everyone isn’t just getting two minutes, but having more gatherings that aren’t managed by staff, inviting more of the community into schools to help and mentor, and to work with partners to put more money in the schools. ",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap. What specific actions do you think the school board should take to close that gap?": "We’re not going to succeed on opportunity gap issues from downtown, I think it has to start from the schools up. Class size has a great deal to do with it, and we need more people working on interventions and alternatives to suspensions and expulsions. We also need to put counselors back in the elementary schools, and more instructional aides, especially with special education kids, because the ratios are just way too high. I don’t think we are reaching different cultures, we’re not asking what they want or need. In order to collaborate, we have to respect people to meet them where they live.",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "I most definitely would not have voted to hire counsel and seek an injunction as my first act.

It was disrespectful to the teaching staff, and to the other staff, where every day they were going to school during the strike and breaking their professional ethics. ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "I am not convinced that the Common Core has been validated, and I am concerned about the “every kid goes to college” mentality. There are jobs out there, journeymen jobs, apprentice jobs, that need to be filled, and we’re not taking a look at those as an acceptable alternative. Somehow we are looking down our nose at those jobs, and that’s a very unhealthy thing for our economy. We need to take another look at vocational education, at other non-college jobs, and how to best educate our kids to get there.  "

The stability with this leadership can be a tremendous asset to the district. My concern is that there are four seats for re-election, and three of them will be new people. That is a tremendous amount of lack of knowledge on the board, so it will be really important that the new board is able to get up to speed quickly and support the superintendent and the policies he is establishing. It will be important for the board to be solid and to make it clear that it’s going to support continued progress and not encourage leadership turnover.",
    "The Seattle School Board has been working to address racial inequity and the achievement gap.

It has to stay narrowly targeted so we can actually have movement. ",
    "What are your thoughts on the recent Seattle teachers strike and the Seattle School Board’s response to the strike?": "It was a really hard thing to have to go through. I had two focuses: Ending it as quickly as possible and doing everything to meet the teachers’ needs. It is so true that our teachers deserve so much more than they get in terms of compensation and resources and support. I voted in favor because my intent was to have it resolve quickly. History has shown that where strikes have gone on, taking legal action has been a catalyst to shortening it. I wanted the superintendent to have that power should it have persisted. I did it on the basis of statistics. ",
    "What do you think about the Common Core standards and current concerns about standardized testing and passage rates?": "I like the idea of the Common Core standards, but there are some problems. It’s not a bad thing to have high standards, but the difficulties that we have are with the standardized testing that is associated with those standards. The actual quality of standardized tests in terms of correctly measuring mastery of the standards is still in question. And the testing has taken on a life of its own in education and is overused. It’s really important that we get back and support teachers with formative testing, which helps teachers know how their students are progressing and helps them refine their practices and lesson plans.
