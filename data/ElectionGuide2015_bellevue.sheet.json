    "b_growth": "We must build the necessary infrastructure, the pipes, the roads and transit, ahead of the growth. We need to pay more attention to all of our neighborhoods and find ways to make housing affordable across the economic spectrum.",

    "b_transit": "To keep people moving, we must increase transportation options and ease congestion. The voters have repeatedly supported light rail and transportation choices. I fully support continuing the path of light rail on the Eastside and will advocate for increased bus rapid transit for all Bellevue neighborhoods.",
    "b_growth": "First we must invest in transportation and transit infrastructure to mitigate traffic. Part of this is technology and broadband so more people can work from home. Second, we need better housing options downtown and in our neighborhoods. Third, neighborhoods must have a voice in development decisions that affect them.",
